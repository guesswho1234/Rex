## Overview

This repository provides an interactive [shiny](https://shiny.posit.co/) dashboard
for creating and evaluating written multiple-choice exams. The underlying workhorse
is [R/exams](https://www.R-exams.org/), in particular the so-called
[NOPS exams](https://www.R-exams.org/tutorials/exams2nops/) which support both
single-choice and multiple-choice exercises along with automatic evaluation.

The dashboard

[Universit√§t Innsbruck](https://www.uibk.ac.at/)

It is developed by [Sebastian Bachler](https://www.uibk.ac.at/ibf/team/bachler.html.en)
and still work-in-progress.
